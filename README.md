# Blockland Timelapse Creator
Timelapse Creator is a HUD and toolset add-on for Blockland that makes creating timelapses easier than ever. This project is currently a work-in-progress and functionality is not guaranteed.

Designed and built by the CityRPG 4 team.

# How it works
The timelapse creator will allow you to take screenshots of a build, either by loading up a set of autosaves or by watching a build's creation in realtime. You can then use the hud to display the dates or other info on each screenshot. Then, you can assemble the screenshots in the editor of your choice to create a timelapse.

# Feedback
This tool was designed for the CityRPG 4 YouTube videos. However, it can be used for any purpose. If it doesn't quite fit your needs or you have any other comments, feel free to reach out to us!
